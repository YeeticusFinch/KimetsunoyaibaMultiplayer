# Kimetsunoyaiba Multiplayer (Forge)

A Forge mod that adds **multiplayer synchronization** for mods using the [PlayerAnimator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/playeranimator) library.  

By default, PlayerAnimator animations are **only visible on the local client**. This mod fixes that limitation by sending animation state over the network, allowing **all players** in a world or server to see each other‚Äôs custom animations (for example, in the [Kimetsu no Yaiba mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kimetsunoyaiba)).

## ‚ú® Features
- Detects when a player starts/stops an animation.  
- Sends animation data (player, animation name, looping flag) to the server.  
- Server rebroadcasts this animation to nearby clients.  
- Other clients play the animation on the correct player using PlayerAnimator.  
- Works in both **LAN** and **dedicated servers**, as long as everyone has this mod installed.  

---

## üõ† Requirements
- **Minecraft Forge** `1.20.x` (other versions may work but are untested).  
- **PlayerAnimator** mod (installed on both client and server).  
- Other mods that use PlayerAnimator (e.g. Kimetsu no Yaiba).

   - `PlayerAnimator`
